# Suspension Morph 
By Christian 'Von Koldskaal'

## Limitations/Assumptions 
* Reads and writes only ASCII stls 
* Positive rake angle means nose down. 
* Assumes that suspension part are NOT moved in the runCase script (can be changed)
* Must specify x-coord for the Center of Rotation
* Must specify the "morph range" i.e. y-coordinate of chassis side hardpoints and y-coordinate of upright hardpoints. (different from front and rear suspension)
